      "I used Nest.js for API development. I opted for a microservices architecture with file upload functionality to an AWS bucket. On the client side, I used Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. I significantly optimized the customer experience by providing them with an easier and faster way to access their social event content, replacing traditional delivery methods such as USB and DVD with an online platform, resulting in a 60% improvement in the customer experience.",

I significantly optimized the QMS by including modules for stamped billing, raw material and finished product inventory management, as well as detailed tracking of the production process for parts. Additionally, I implemented specific functionalities to meet required certifications, such as generating Code 128 labels for efficient product delivery to customers. Furthermore, we streamlined production, packaging, and billing processes by 20%. Moreover, thanks to the implementation of AWS for file management, I reduced document access and retrieval time by 30% compared to previous methods.",
